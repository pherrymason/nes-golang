<h1>6502 Addressing Modes</h1><p>When the 6502 refers to addressing 
modes, it really means "What is the source of the data used in this 
instruction?"  The 6502's data book divides the addressing modes into 2 
groups, indexed and non-indexed.  That seems to be a logical way to 
discuss them, so I'll stick with that.</p>
<h3>Non-Indexed, non memory</h3>
<p>Most of the addressing modes are used to access memory, but 3 do not.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulator</strong></p>
<p>These instructions have register A (the accumulator) as the target.  Examples are <code>LSR  A</code> and <code>ROL   A</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate</strong> </p>
<p>These instructions have their data defined as the next byte after the opcode.  <code>ORA #$B2</code> will perform a logical (also called bitwise) of the value B2 with the accumulator.  <em>Remember
 that in assembly when you see a # sign, it indicates an immediate 
value.  If $B2 was written without a #, it would indicate an address or 
offset.</em></p>
<p><strong>Implied</strong></p>
<p>In an implied instruction, the data and/or destination is mandatory for the instruction.  For example, the <code>CLC</code> instruction is implied, it is going to clear the processor's Carry flag.</p>
<h3>Non-Indexed memory ops</h3>
<p><strong>Relative</strong></p>
<p>Relative addressing on the 6502 is only used for branch operations.  
The byte after the opcode is the branch offset.  If the branch is taken,
 the new address will the the current PC plus the offset.  The offset is
 a signed byte, so it can jump a maximum of 127 bytes forward, or 128 
bytes backward.  (For more info about signed numbers,  check <a href="http://www.emulator101.com/more-about-binary-numbers.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Absolute</strong></p>
<p>Absolute addressing specifies the memory location explicitly in the two bytes following the opcode.  So <code>JMP $4032</code> will set the PC to $4032.  The hex for this is <code>4C 32 40</code>.
  The 6502 is a little endian machine, so any 16 bit (2 byte) value is 
stored with the LSB first.  All instructions that use absolute 
addressing are 3 bytes.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-Page</strong></p>
<p>Zero-Page is an addressing mode that is only capable of addressing 
the first 256 bytes of the CPU's memory map.  You can think of it as 
absolute addressing for the first 256 bytes.  The instruction <code>LDA $35</code>
 will put the value stored in memory location $35 into A.  The advantage
 of zero-page are two - the instruction takes one less byte to specify, 
and it executes in less CPU cycles.  Most programs are written to store 
the most frequently used variables in the first 256 memory locations so 
they can take advantage of zero page addressing.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect</strong></p>
<p>The JMP instruction is the only instruction that uses this addressing
 mode.  It is a 3 byte instruction - the 2nd and 3rd bytes are an 
absolute address.  The set the PC to the address stored at that address.
  So maybe this would be clearer.</p>
<pre>   Memory:    
   1000 52 3a 04 d3 93 00 3f 93 84

   Instruction:    
   JMP  ($1000)    
</pre>

<p>When this instruction is executed, the PC will be set to $3a52, which is the address stored at address $1000.</p>
<h3>Indexed memory ops</h3>
<p>The 6502 has the ability to do indexed addressing, where the X or Y 
register is used as an extra offset to the address being accessed.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Indexed</strong></p>
<p>This addressing mode makes the target address by adding the contents 
of the X or Y register to an absolute address.  For example, this 6502 
code can be used to fill 10 bytes with $FF starting at address $1009, 
counting down to address $1000.</p>
<pre>   LDA #$FF    
   LDY #$09    
   loop:    
   STA $1000,Y ; absolute indexed addressing    
   DEY    
   BPL loop    
</pre>

<p><strong>Zero-Page Indexed</strong>   </p>
<p>This works just like absolute indexed, but the target address is limited to the first 0xFF bytes.  </p>
<p>The target address will wrap around and will always be in the zero page.  If the instruction is <code>LDA $C0,X</code>,
 and X is $60, then the target address will be $20.  $C0+$60 = $120, but
 the carry is discarded in the calculation of the target address.</p>
<p><strong>Indexed Indirect</strong>    </p>
<p>This mode is only used with the X register.  Consider a situation where the instruction is <code>LDA ($20,X)</code>, X contains $04, and memory at $24 contains <code>0024: 74 20</code>,
 First, X is added to $20 to get $24.  The target address will be 
fetched from $24 resulting in a target address of $2074.  Register A 
will be loaded with the contents of memory at $2074.</p>
<p>If X + the immediate byte will wrap around to a zero-page address.  So you could code that like <code>targetAddress = (X + opcode[1]) &amp; 0xFF</code> .</p>
<p>Indexed Indirect instructions are 2 bytes - the second byte is the 
zero-page address - $20 in the example.  Obviously the fetched address 
has to be stored in the zero page.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Indexed</strong>    </p>
<p>This mode is only used with the Y register.   It differs in the order
 that Y is applied to the indirectly fetched address.  An example 
instruction that uses indirect index addressing is <code>LDA ($86),Y</code>
 .  To calculate the target address, the CPU will first fetch the 
address stored at zero page location $86.  That address will be added to
 register Y to get the final target address.  For <code>LDA ($86),Y</code>, if the address stored at $86 is $4028 (memory is  <code>0086: 28 40</code>,
 remember little endian) and register Y contains $10, then the final 
target address would be $4038.  Register A will be loaded with the 
contents of memory at $4038.</p>
<p>Indirect Indexed instructions are 2 bytes - the second byte is the 
zero-page address - $20 in the example.  (So the fetched address has to 
be stored in the zero page.)</p>
<p>While indexed indirect addressing will only generate a zero-page 
address, this mode's target address is not wrapped - it can be anywhere 
in the 16-bit address space. </p><a href="http://www.emulator101.com/6502-emulator.html">← Prev: 6502-emulator</a> &nbsp; <a href="http://www.emulator101.com/6502-disassembler.html">Next: 6502-disassembler →</a> <br><br><br><p>Post questions or comments on Twitter @realemulator101, or if you find issues in the code, file them on
